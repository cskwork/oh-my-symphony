# Symphony after_create hook — extracted from WORKFLOW.md.
#
# Attach the empty ticket workspace as a git worktree of the host repo on a
# per-ticket `symphony/<ID>` branch, symlink (or junction on Windows) any
# host-owned board roots back into the worktree, and prime a Python venv for
# the agent. Behaviour is identical to the inline hook that previously lived
# inside WORKFLOW.md — see workflow-v0.5.2.md (C4) for the rationale.
#
# Env vars consumed (Symphony injects these before invoking the hook):
#   SYMPHONY_WORKFLOW_DIR        Path to the host repo containing WORKFLOW.md.
#   SYMPHONY_FEATURE_BASE_BRANCH Optional override for the new branch's start point.
#   SYMPHONY_MERGE_TARGET_BRANCH Optional override for the Document-gate merge target.
#   SYMPHONY_BOARD_ROOT_NAME     Board root relative to SYMPHONY_WORKFLOW_DIR
#                                (e.g. `kanban`, `board`). Defaults to `kanban`
#                                for hand-written configs that predate it. A
#                                board that is not linked here leaves the worker
#                                writing a private board copy the orchestrator
#                                never sees.
