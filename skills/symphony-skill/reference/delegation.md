# Delegating sub-tasks to Symphony

When the user gives a large task that decomposes into N independent
sub-tasks, you (the main conversational agent) can offload each sub-task
to Symphony rather than doing them inline. Each spawned worker runs in a
**fresh LLM session** with its own context window — so the calling agent's
context only carries the orchestration overhead, not all sub-implementations.

## Recipe

1. **Frame the objective** before creating files: one goal, expected user or
   operator outcome, constraints, out of scope, and proof commands. If the
   request is really one small change, create one ticket instead of a board.

   Classify the work type before decomposition. The ticket map should match the
   job:

   | Work type | First ticket owns | Final proof owns |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Bugfix | Reproduction, suspected area, failing test/log | Regression closes repro + focused suite |
   | Feature/enhancement | Behavior contract and acceptance criteria | Integration for changed workflow |
   | Customer-facing app delivery | Product brief and workflow matrix | Merged-target release verification |
   | Release/integration only | Current merged state and release risks | Full launch/build/customer-flow proof |
   | Docs/config/tooling | Exact affected surface and rollback risk | Static checks + no-runtime-change rationale |
   | Research/spike | Unknowns, evidence plan, decision criteria | Decision note + follow-up ticket list |

   Do not register product-discovery tickets for a narrow bugfix unless the bug
   exposes a missing product contract. Do not register a single broad
   `implement app` ticket when the work is customer-facing app delivery.

   For customer-facing app work, frame the product before the implementation
   queue. Do not decompose straight into screens or tables. Capture:

   - target customer and the job they need done;
   - comparable product or domain research used, with sources or explicit
     assumptions when live research is unavailable;
   - core customer workflows that must work end to end;
   - must-have functionality, non-goals, and market-ready gaps;
   - data, auth, permissions, security, deploy, and seed/demo-data assumptions;
   - the declared launch path and final release verification command set.

2. **Decompose** the request into independent tickets, each with a
   self-contained spec. Independence is critical: Symphony runs eligible
   tickets concurrently up to `agent.max_concurrent_agents`. Use `blocked_by`
   for real dependencies, and use ticket IDs to express FIFO order among
   otherwise eligible tickets.

   A good ticket slice has all of these:

   - independently testable without relying on unfinished work;
   - one contract owner: a route, data model, CLI behavior, UI flow, or
     integration boundary;
   - small implementation surface: roughly <=5 files and <=500 net lines for a
     Build ticket;
   - explicit acceptance criteria, including edge/error cases;
   - exact verification commands the worker can run.

   Bad slices: `misc cleanup`, `implement app`, `frontend polish`, or two
   tickets that must edit the same behavior without an ordered dependency.

   For a new app or major product surface, the first ticket is a
   product-readiness brief, not code. It owns the user research summary,
   customer workflow map, feature inventory, and release acceptance matrix.
   Build tickets consume that brief. A final release-verification ticket is
   blocked by every Build ticket and proves the merged target branch runs as a
   coherent product.

3. **Register** each as a Symphony ticket with a rich description (this
   description is the only context the worker gets, plus the WORKFLOW.md
   prompt template):

   ```bash
   symphony board new TASK-001 "<title>" \
     --priority 2 \
     --description "<full spec + acceptance criteria + file pointers>"
   ```

   Number tickets in the same order you created the task list. Do not let a
   later task receive a lower suffix, because the dispatcher treats
   `TASK-001` as earlier work than `TASK-002` regardless of priority.

4. **Launch headless** (TUI requires a TTY you don't have):

   ```bash
   symphony ./WORKFLOW.md --port 9999 2>> log/symphony.log &
   ```

5. **Poll for completion** at sensible intervals (don't tight-loop):

   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/state \
     | jq '.counts, .running[].issue_identifier'
   symphony board ls --state Done
   ```

6. **Collect results** by reading the `## Resolution` section of each
   completed ticket file:

   ```bash
   symphony board show TASK-A
   ```

## Ticket prompt template

Use this shape for `--description`. Keep it compact but complete; the worker
should not need the original chat.

```text
Goal:
- <one outcome in user/operator terms>

Scope:
- In: <files, flows, APIs, or components this ticket owns>
- Out: <nearby work this ticket must not touch>

Dependencies:
- blocked_by: <ticket ids or "none">
- Contracts to preserve: <public API, schema, prompt, CLI, UI behavior>

Acceptance criteria:
- WHEN <event> THEN <observable behavior>
- IF <edge/error case> THEN <observable behavior>

Implementation notes:
- Prefer existing helpers/patterns: <paths>
- Avoid: <risky shortcut or unrelated refactor>

Verification:
- <exact unit/integration command>
- <lint/type/build command if relevant>
- For app delivery: <merged-target start command + customer workflow smoke>

Done evidence:
- Append a Resolution with changed files, tests run, and residual risk.
```

If a dependency is real, add it to the ticket frontmatter after creation:

```yaml
blocked_by:
  - TASK-001
```

Symphony workers should still self-check blockers with
`symphony board show <ID>` because frontmatter is advisory metadata, not a
distributed lock.

## Application-development slice patterns

For a typical app change, separate by behavior and proof surface:

```text
TASK-001  Product readiness brief + release matrix (no deps)
TASK-002  Data model / migration / fixtures        (deps: TASK-001)
TASK-003  Core service or API behavior + tests     (deps: TASK-001,TASK-002)
TASK-004  Primary customer workflow UI + tests     (deps: TASK-001,TASK-003)
TASK-005  Secondary workflow / edge states         (deps: TASK-001,TASK-003)
TASK-006  Release verification on merged target    (deps: TASK-002..005)
TASK-007  Delivery docs / changelog / commit prep  (deps: TASK-006)
```

The release-verification ticket is not a paperwork ticket. It checks out or
uses the merged target branch after prior tickets land, runs install/build/start
from a clean-ish operator path, waits for readiness, drives the core customer
flows in a browser or API client, records console/network/server failures, and
states whether the app is market-ready or which customer-critical gaps remain.
If the app cannot start (`curl 000`, no listening port, failed build, missing
env, broken seed data), the ticket blocks delivery instead of moving to Learn.

For a bug:

```text
TASK-001  Reproduce failure with failing test/log (no deps)
TASK-002  Minimal fix + focused tests             (deps: TASK-001)
TASK-003  Regression verification + full suite    (deps: TASK-002)
```

Bugfix ticket descriptions must include the observed failure, expected
behavior, suspected area or "unknown", reproduction command/log, fix boundary,
regression command, and what would still be `Not proven`. They should not ask
the worker to redesign unrelated product flows.

For a bounded feature/enhancement:

```text
TASK-001  Behavior contract + acceptance matrix   (no deps)
TASK-002  Implementation + focused tests          (deps: TASK-001)
TASK-003  Changed-workflow integration proof      (deps: TASK-002)
```

Feature tickets own one behavior change. If the change becomes a new product
surface, route it through the app-delivery pattern instead of silently expanding
scope.

For browser UI:

```text
TASK-001  Product/customer workflow contract
TASK-002  Data/API contract
TASK-003  UI implementation
TASK-004  Responsive/accessibility/browser QA
TASK-005  Merged-app release proof
```

One Verify ticket per release is usually better than one Verify ticket per
Build ticket; it catches integration failures and keeps the evidence ledger in
one place.

## When this pattern wins

- Large, parallelizable work (N independent features / fixes / migrations).
- Each sub-task fits in a worker's context — the orchestrator can't help
  if a sub-task itself is too big.
- The user is happy to wait for a polling cycle rather than streaming
  output.

## When this pattern *doesn't* win

- Sub-tasks have ordering dependencies you cannot encode with `blocked_by`.
- The user expects real-time visibility into each sub-agent's reasoning
  (Symphony exposes only event-level logs, not the agent's stream).
- There is no callback / push notification — the calling agent must poll.

## Distinction from in-session TodoWrite

| Aspect       | Claude Code TodoWrite                  | Symphony delegation                       |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Execution    | same agent, same session               | N separate subprocesses, fresh sessions   |
| Context      | within calling agent's context         | each worker has its own context           |
| Sync         | synchronous, inline                    | asynchronous, polling required            |
| Best for     | steps within one conversation          | independent work units, large fan-out     |

The two compose: one Symphony worker can use TodoWrite internally to
track the sub-steps of *its* sub-task.

## Quality of decomposition matters more than mechanism

Symphony will faithfully run whatever you put in front of it. The hard
part is human-side decomposition:

- Each ticket's `description` should read like a self-contained spec:
  acceptance criteria, file pointers, test commands, dependencies, and proof.
  The worker has no conversation history.
- Avoid sub-tasks that require shared in-memory state. If two tickets
  must agree on a schema, write the schema down in a third ticket (or in
  a file the workspace will pick up via `after_create`) before launching
  them.
- Time-box experiments: start with `agent.max_turns: 5` and `agent.max_concurrent_agents: 1`
  while validating the decomposition. Crank up only after seeing a clean
  run.
